Task 1: Error Detection
1.	Data Quality Constraints
All the mentioned data quality constraints (Capitalization of All Characters, State Column, City Column, ZIP Column and SSN Column) helped us to detect errors. 
•	For State Column, We used online Web Table for matching state names with true state names i.e. https://www.50states.com/abbreviations.htm 
•	For City Column, it is compared with a city column of downloaded Lookup Table.
•	 For ZIP Column if there is any character in it and if its length is less than or greater than 5 than it is an error.
•	Similarly, if there is any special character in SSN Column and its length is less than 8 and greater than 10 than it is also an error.

2.	Precision, Recall and F1
-----------------Error Detection Results-----------------
•	Number of detected cells: 357590 (Number of changed values)
•	Number of Correctly Detected cells: 335779 (cell was correctly identified as an error)
•	Detection precision: 0.939005565033 (ratio of correctly detected cells over all detected cells)
•	Detection recall: 0.86512884991 (ratio of correctly detected cells over all erroneous cells in the data)
•	Detection F1: 0.90055463474


	
Task 2: Error Correction
1.	Data Quality Constraints
All the mentioned data quality constraints (Capitalization of All Characters, State Column, City Column, ZIP Column and SSN Column) and Jaro Distance Algorithm helped us to correct errors. 
•	We used online Web Table for matching state names with true state names i.e. https://www.50states.com/abbreviations.htm  if there is a match between given input and web table entry than it is correct and if for any input Jaro Distance matching result is greater than 80% than the entry is replaced with correct value of web table otherwise that value is replaced with null.
•	 Similarly, City Column is compared with a city column of downloaded Lookup Table, if there is a match between given input and lookup table entry than it is correct and if for any input Jaro Distance matching result is greater than 80% than the entry is replaced with correct value of lookup table otherwise that value is replaced with null. 
•	For ZIP Column we just removed all the characters and just picked all the digits and if its length is less than 5 than just appended extra zeroes at its end and if it is greater than 5 than just picked first 5 digits by eliminating all others.
•	Similarly, for SSN Column we just removed all the special characters and just picked all the digits and if its length is less than 8 than just appended extra zeroes at its end and if it is greater than 10 than just picked first 10 digits by eliminating all others.

2.	Precision, Recall and F1
-----------------Error Correction Results-----------------
•	Destroyed clean cells: 21811 (cell was correct but has been transformed into a wrong value)
•	Wrongly cleaned cells: 82643 (cell was wrong, but the cleaning was also not correct)
•	Undetected cells: 52347 (cell was erroneous but was not touched)
•	Number of cells that need yet to be cleaned: 156801 (sum of the 3 cell types above)
•	Correction precision = 0.707894516066 (ratio of correctly corrected cells over all changed cells)
•	Correction recall = 0.65220057404 (ratio of correctly corrected cells over all erroneous cells in the data)
•	Correction F1: 0.678907251554
